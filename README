Setup script for installing kat5200 (atari 5200 emulator) in retropie.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Usage (from a (SSH) terminal):
wget -N https://raw.githubusercontent.com/futurechild/Kat5200-Retropie/master/install
chmod +x install
./install



Notes:
------
F1 key for invoking the debugger has been removed.

By default a (default) configuration file gets copied over everytime the emulator is started, this can be stopped by editing emulators.cfg and removing the following:
cp -f /opt/retropie/configs/atari5200/default_config.db3 /home/pi/.kat5200/kat5200.db3 ;

Configuration has to be done with keyboard/mouse (press escape for menu).

Configuration files can be saved by entering the following command (change the destination name if needed !):
cp /home/pi/.kat5200/kat5200.db3 /opt/retropie/configs/atari5200/saved_config.db3

At this point the emulator does not support specifying config files.
Future versions should have this option according to it's developer. 
The following is a way to get around this until a new version is available:
edit emulators.cfg and make a new entry with changed emulator name and config file name (i.e. add the following line):
config1 = "cp -f /opt/retropie/configs/atari5200/config1.db3 /home/pi/.kat5200/kat5200.db3 ;/usr/local/bin/kat5200 %ROM%"

The standard emulator does not support combination buttons (ie start+select) to perform functions (ie quit).
Future versions may have this option according to it's developer.
This version has hardcoded button combination SELECT (Nr. 8) and START (Nr. 9) to exit the emulator.
Note, this only works when the joystick is enabled (at least one function has been assigned to a button) and menu is not active.
