Setup script for installing kat5200 (atari 5200 emulator) in retropie.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Usage (from a (SSH) terminal):
wget -N https://raw.githubusercontent.com/futurechild/Kat5200-Retropie/master/install
chmod +x install
./install



Notes:
------
By default a (default) configuration file gets copied over everytime the emulator is started, this can be stopped by editing emulators.cfg and removing the following:
yes | cp -rf /opt/retropie/configs/atari5200/default_config.db3 /home/pi/.kat5200/kat5200.db3 ;

Configuration has to be done with keyboard/mouse.

Configuration files can be saved by entering the following command (remeber to change the destination name if needed !):
cp /home/pi/.kat5200/kat5200.db3 /opt/retropie/configs/atari5200/default_config.db3


At this point the emulator does not support specifying config files.
Future versions should have this option according to it's developer. 
The following is a way to get around this until a new version is available:
edit emulators.cfg and make a new entry with changed emulator name and config file name (i.e. add the following line):
config1 = "yes | cp -rf /opt/retropie/configs/atari5200/config1.db3 /home/pi/.kat5200/kat5200.db3 ;/opt/retropie/emulators/retroarch/bin/retroarch -L /usr/local/bin/kat5200 %ROM%"


The emulator does not support combination buttons (ie start+select) to perform functions (ie quit).
Future versions may have this option according to it's developer.
Perhaps, in the meantime, this can be solved with joy2key ?
